# Make Email templates

- Just do `npm install` no sudo required. Patiently wait untill all the dependencies are installed.
- For templating we use `Jade` and for stylesheets we use `sass`, browsersing for testing and livereload
- use `gulp watch` to start development environment
- once you are done editing run `gulp inlinecss` to inline the css, find your files in `/dist/inline_css` folder
- To test tage the body code of each file from `/dist/inline_css` and drop it in <https://putsmail.com/>
